//! A bounded FIFO that absorbs input burst.
//!
//! MoQ (and every other object/datagram transport) delivers transport packets in
//! bursts. The jitter buffer holds them until the scheduler releases them on the
//! output byte clock, smoothing the burst into a steady stream. It is bounded: a
//! sustained input rate above the configured bitrate can't grow it without limit,
//! it drops the oldest packet instead, which keeps both latency and memory
//! bounded (the broadcast trade-off: shed the stalest media, hold the clock).
